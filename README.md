# Teleport Request
Allows players to request from another player to be teleported to them.

## Privileges
Each command needs a privilege. These are the following privileges:
- `tp` is required in order to use all commands.
- `tp_tpc` is required in order to use `/tpc`.
- `tp_tpc` is required in order to use `/tpe`.
- `tp_tpc` is required in order to use `/tpj`.
- `interact` is required to use all commands.
- `tp_admin` gives more control to admins: 
   - Admins can teleport to players even when they haven't decided to accept, or not.
   - Admins can teleport players to him/her, if the `enable_immediate_teleport` setting is enabled.
   - Admins can teleport to protected coordinates.

Players can also teleport to coordinates, however, if the area is protected, the teleport will be denied.

## How to use
Each command does a function. "**Example Usage**" is an example of how to use the command.   
Note there must be 2 players in order to make the commands to work: a player must send a request to another player.

There are two ways of sending a request:   
1. A request which teleports you to the specified player (command `/tpr <player>`).   
2. A request which teleports the specified player to you (command `/tphr <player>`).    

To accept a request some sent you, you must use `/tpy`.   
These are the following commands available in-game:

``` /tpr [playername] ```
- **Name:** Teleport Request
- **Description:** Requests permission to teleport to another player, where [playername] is their exact name.
- **Required Privileges:** `interact, tp`
- **Example Usage:** `/tpr RobbieF` requests permission from RobbieF to teleport to them.
- **Notes:** Usernames are case-sensitive. If you have the `tp_admin` privilege, you will immediately teleport to the specificed player (does not apply if `enable_immediate_teleport` setting is disabled, enabled by default).

``` /tphr [playername] ```
- **Name:** Teleport Here Request
- **Description:** Request permission to teleport another player to you.
- **Required Privileges:** `interact, tp`
- **Example Usage:** `/tphr RobbieF` requests RobbieF to teleport to you.
- **Notes:** Usernames are case-sensitive. If you have the `tp_admin` privilege, RobbieF will teleport to you immediately (does not apply if `enable_immediate_teleport` setting is disabled, enabled by default).

``` /tpc [x,y,z] ```
- **Name:** Teleport to Coordinates
- **Description:** Teleport to coordinates.
- **Required Privileges:** `interact, tp_tpc, tp`
- **Notes:** Honors area protection. If the area is protected, it must be owned by you in order to teleport to it, or you must have the `areas` privilege in order to teleport to those coordinates.

``` /tpj [axis] [distance] ```
- **Name:** Teleport Jump
- **Description:** Teleport a specified distance along a single specified axis.
- **Required Privilege:** `interact", tp, tp_tpc`
- **Available Options for *axis*:** x, y, z
- **Example Usage:** `/tpj y 10` teleport 10 nodes into the air.

``` /tpe ```
- **Name:** Teleport Evade
- **Description:** In a sticky situation? Evade your enemy by teleporting to several nearby coordinates in random pattern. There's no knowing where you'll end up.
- **Required Privileges:** `interact, tp_tpc, tp`
- **Example Usage:** `/tpe` teleports you to a random number of random coordinates in an evasive pattern.

``` /tpy ```
- **Description:** Accept a user's request to teleport to you or teleport you to them.

``` /tpn ```
- **Description:** Deny a user's request to teleport to you or teleport you to them.

## Configuring the mod
Open your `minetest.conf` located in your Minetest directory.     
Set the values of the settings you'd like to.

Available options are:
```
tp.timeout_delay = 60
tp.enable_immediate_teleport = true
tp_enable_tpp_command = false
```
Those values are the default values of the mod.   
You can also go to your Minetest, Settings tab, All settings, Mods, and you'll find `tpr` there.    
Or another way to do it, is changing the values in `settingtypes.txt`.

## Installation
- Unzip the archive, rename the folder to `tpr` and
place it in .. minetest/mods/

- GNU/Linux: If you use a system-wide installation place
    it in ~/.minetest/mods/.

- If you only want this to be used in a single world, place
    the folder in .. worldmods/ in your world directory.

## TODO
- Make it so if a player attempts to teleport to coordinates within a protected area owned by another player, and that player is online, the owner receives a request to allow or deny the user from teleporting to their area.
- Add limitations to /tpc which only allow a user to teleport X number of blocks. Prevents users from teleporting to the edge of the world.
- Assess value in changing all tpr-based chat commands to one global command such as /tp to reduce the chance of confusion between tps_admin and the original mod (and also make it so people don't have to remember so many commands).
- Create a better sound effect for teleport and apply it to all teleport methods (not just /tpc)
- Rewrite to place all chat commands into one single command much like how /teleport works.
- Make evade respect land: no teleporting inside land, but instead make sure player is standing on surface or in water.
